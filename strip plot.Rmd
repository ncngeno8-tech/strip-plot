## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

```

```{r}
data(mtcars)
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl) 

```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Minimal Strip Plot: MPG by Cylinder Count",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Miles Per Gallon"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
ggsave("strip_plot.png", width = 8, height = 5)
